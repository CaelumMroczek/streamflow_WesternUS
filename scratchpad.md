-   Put together initial usgs streamgage filtering process to be sent to Jake - CM

## To Do:

-   Get USGS streamgages for all western states

    -   NM, WY, CO, AZ, MT, ID, UT, NV, CA, WA, OR

    -   Filter out sites with less than 10 years of data, only count years if they have \> 335 days of recorded data

-   **Challenge Question:** Is there a dataset indicating streams that have anthropogenic impacts (dams, excessive urbanization, etc.)
